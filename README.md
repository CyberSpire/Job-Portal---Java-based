# Job Management System
Collaboration with [Believer2722](https://github.com/Believer2722)

>The Job Management System is a Java-based application developed using Hibernate for data management. It facilitates job application and recruitment processes without a graphical user interface (GUI), making it suitable for command-line usage. This project enables candidates to apply for available jobs and recruiters to post job listings, with functionalities for user registration, job posting, job application, and more.

## Features:
1. ``User Registration``: Candidates and recruiters can register themselves with the system, providing essential details for identification and communication purposes.
2. ``Job Posting``: Recruiters can post job listings, specifying job titles, descriptions, requirements, and other relevant information.
3. ``Job Application``: Candidates can browse through available job listings and apply for positions of interest, submitting their resumes and other required documents.
4. ``Data Management``: Utilizes Hibernate for efficient management of application data, ensuring reliability and scalability.
5. ``Application Status Tracking``: Candidates can view the status of their job applications, including whether they are pending, accepted, or rejected.
6. ``Command-Line Interface``: Although the project does not have a graphical user interface (GUI), it offers a CLI for interacting with the system, providing a straightforward interface for users.
